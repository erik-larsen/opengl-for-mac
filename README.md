![Native Mac GLES app](sdl_gles_minimal.png)

Simplify development of native Mac apps using OpenGL (specifically OpenGL ES) and SDL2.

Having a Mac native OpenGL ES + SDL2 build can be helpful when developing for Emscripten and WebGL, to aid in debugging and comparison between native and web builds.  More generally, having OpenGL ES (GLES) available enables continuing to do general OpenGL development on Mac.

While Apple has dropped OpenGL and GLES in favor of Metal, Google's ANGLE project can be used to fill the void.  ANGLE provides hardware accelerated GLES in Chromium browsers across many platforms, including Mac, where OpenGL is implemented on top of Metal.  So by packaging up the ANGLE GLES headers and libraries here, OpenGL development on Mac is restored.

Specifically, this repository provides:
- Ready-to-use GLES headers and libraries, without having to download and build ANGLE.
- A very minimal GLES + SDL2 hello triangle sample that builds to Mac executable and Emscripten web page.  
  All code is in one file, with the same code building to Mac and Emscripten, save for a few short #ifdef's. Build instructions are included.
- Steps to obtain the latest GLES headers via ANGLE and the latest GLES libraries via Chrome.
- Steps to build ANGLE from scratch, should you want to build GLES libraries yourself.  
  NOTE: The ANGLE build consumes ~35GB as of June 2024.
  
Thanks to [grplyer](https://github.com/grplyler) and [Peter0x44](https://github.com/Peter0x44) for the [steps](https://medium.com/@grplyler/building-and-linking-googles-angle-with-raylib-on-macos-67b07cd380a3) to copy GLES libraries from a local Chrome installation and for showing how to build ANGLE on Mac.

### Obtain the latest GLES headers and libraries
```
# Copy ANGLE GLES headers to opengl-for-mac
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle
export ANGLE=/path/to/angle
cp -r $ANGLE/include/EGL   $OGL_FOR_MAC/include
cp -r $ANGLE/include/GLES  $OGL_FOR_MAC/include
cp -r $ANGLE/include/GLES2 $OGL_FOR_MAC/include
cp -r $ANGLE/include/KHR   $OGL_FOR_MAC/include

# Copy Chrome GLES libraries to opengl-for-mac
install Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser-tools/    
cp "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Frameworks/Google Chrome Framework.framework/Versions/Current/Libraries/libGLESv2.dylib" $OGL_FOR_MAC/lib
cp "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Frameworks/Google Chrome Framework.framework/Versions/Current/Libraries/libEGL.dylib" $OGL_FOR_MAC/lib
```
